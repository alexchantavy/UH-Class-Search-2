      | I first started writing UH Find in 2010 when I was still at UH and found 
      | myself using the <a href="https://www.sis.hawaii.edu/uhdad/avail.classes?i=MAN&t=201510">current web system</a> to search for classes.
      | <a href="http://github.com/alexchantavy/UH-Class-Search">Early versions</a> 
      | of my scripts weren't really usable by anyone other than me, and I've 
      | spent a lot of time trying to make something that can benefit all Manoa
      | students. 
    p
      | Currently UH Find works only for the Manoa campus but if there's enough
      | demand and support I'll do the same thing for the CCs.  The data gets 
      | updated once a day but I can adjust this if enough people are interested.

      | Feel free to contact me on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alexchantavy">@alexchantavy</a>
      | if you have any suggestions or questions.  I'll be continually working to 
      | make it better.
