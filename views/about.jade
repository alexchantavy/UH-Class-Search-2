  h1(class="page-overview") About
  p 
    | I first started writing UH Find in 2010 when I was still at UH and found 
    | myself frustrated using the <a href="https://www.sis.hawaii.edu/uhdad/avail.classes?i=MAN&t=201510">current web system</a> to search for classes.
    | <a href="http://github.com/alexchantavy/UH-Class-Search">Early versions</a> 
    | of my scripts weren't really usable by anyone other than me, and over the past few years I've 
    | spent a lot of time putting together a product that I hope can benefit all Manoa
    | students.

    | or chantavy< at > gmail if you have any suggestions or questions.  I'll 
    | be continually working to make it better.
